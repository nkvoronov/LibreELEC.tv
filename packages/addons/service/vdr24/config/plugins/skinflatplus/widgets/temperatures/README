This Widget provide information about the system temperatures.

You must manually create a link to the corresponding script, for example:
ln -s temperatures.default temperatures

The command "temperatures" will be executed every time the widget is drawn, so please keep it short and fast.
The command can provide three temperatures: cpu, pc case and gpu temperature
The command can also be called from system information widget. So the output files must also begin with 01_ - 99_ for sort/position. 

Please install lm-sensors and configure it for your system. See the default script for an example.
