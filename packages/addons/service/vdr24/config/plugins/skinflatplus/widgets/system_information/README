This widget provides several information about the current system state.

You must manually create a link to the corresponding script, for example:
ln -s system_information.ubuntu system_information

The command "system_information" will be executed every time the widget is drawn, so please keep it short and fast.
The command "system_information" must provide several files with the infos.
The output files must begin with 01_ - 99_ for sort/position the info in the widget. For example "01_uptime", "02_load", etc.The values will be drawn in 2 columns except "system_version" and "kernel_version" they are drawn in a row.
For example:
System Version: Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS
Load: 0.32      Uptime: 10:24:42 up 88 days

You can include system_updatestatus and temperatures. But do not execute the system_updatestatus script (please read README of system_updatestatus)

Please see the example!
