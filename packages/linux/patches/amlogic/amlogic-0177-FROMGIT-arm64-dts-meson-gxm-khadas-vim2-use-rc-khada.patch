Subject: [PATCH 177/187] FROMGIT: arm64: dts: meson-gxm-khadas-vim2: use
 rc-khadas remote

Khadas shipped the first batch of VIM devices with the 'geekbox' remote from
another of their brands. All further shipments have used a 'khadas' branded
remote that provides an Android mouse function instead of KEY_SCREEN. As the
IR keycode for the geekbox screen button is different to the khadas mouse
button KEY_SCREEN doesn't work on the Khadas remote, so swap to the rc-khadas
keymap to gain an extra button mapped to KEY_MUTE.
