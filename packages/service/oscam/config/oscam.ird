# oscam.ird
# for irdeto
# Irdeto guessing table by signature for OSCam
#
# Format:
# <byte3>:<byte4-7>:<CAID>:<SID>
#
# Example:
# 12:000000a:12ab:cd01
#
# It is recommended to create an empty oscam.ird (eg with "touch oscam.ird"), since otherwise the boot sends an indication that this file was not found!
