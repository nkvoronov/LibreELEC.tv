**License**

**Copyright**

As LibreELEC includes code from many upstream projects it has many copyright owners; notably [OpenELEC](https://openelec.tv) which we forked from after disagreeing with project direction and management, and [OpenBricks/GeeXboX](https://github.com/OpenBricks/openbricks/blob/master/AUTHORS) the uncredited source of the original 2009 build system. LibreELEC makes no claim of copyright on any upstream code. However all original LibreELEC authored code is copyright LibreELEC.tv. Patches to upstream code have the same license as the upstream project unless specified otherwise. For a complete copyright list please checkout the source code to examine license headers. Unless expressly stated otherwise all code submitted to the LibreELEC project (in any form) is licensed under [GPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) and copyright is donated to the project. This approach gives the project freedom to maintain the code without the overhead of preserving contact with every submitter, e.g. GPLv3. You are free to retain copyright by adding your copyright header to each submitted code page. If you submit code that is not your own work it is your responsibility to place a header stating the copyright.
